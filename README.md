Power BI Dashboard Project ‚Äî Call Center Performance Analysis
üìÅ Project Overview

This project analyzes call center performance using Power BI.
The dataset includes call records, agent details, product sales, and call duration metrics.
The goal is to design an interactive dashboard to monitor agent performance, call outcomes, and overall conversion efficiency.

Total Products Sold	Total successful conversions	SUM(ProductSold)
üìà Visualizations Included

Cards ‚Äî Display key metrics like total calls, sales, conversion rate.

Bar Chart ‚Äî Show total calls and sales by each agent.

üé® Dashboard Design Steps

Step 1: Import dataset into Power BI.
Step 2: Clean and format data using Power Query.
Step 3: Create DAX measures for KPIs.
Step 4: Add visualizations and arrange them in logical layout.
Step 5: Add slicers (Agent, PickedUp).
Step 6: Apply consistent color theme for clarity.
Step 7: Add navigation buttons and page titles.
Step 8: Export and summarize in PowerPoint presentation.

üß† Insights

Agents with higher call pickups show higher conversion rates.

Shorter call durations often correlate with missed opportunities.

Conversion performance varies significantly among agents.
